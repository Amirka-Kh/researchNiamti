# Amazing Relation of Developer and Project Estimations

## Abstract

Accurate project estimation and developer contribution analysis are critical to the success of software development projects. This research addresses the challenges of linking developer productivity metrics to project estimation, with the goal of improving project planning, tracking, and overall team efficiency. We analyzed a wide range of productivity metrics, identifying those that are most closely linked to project outcomes, such as \_**\_ and \_\_**. Using this analysis, we developed a tool that analyzes developer performance based on GitHub repository data. The tool tracks individual contributions, links these statistics to project estimation, and includes a feature for predicting potential project cost overruns.

Our tool was tested in a real-world setting by a software development company. The results were encouraging: the tool identified a developer who claimed to be overworked but whose contributions were average compared to the rest of the team. The situation led to the developer's voluntary departure, which, according to the company, had a positive impact on team morale and overall productivity. These findings demonstrate the potential of our tool to improve both project estimation and team dynamics, ultimately contributing to more efficient project management.

## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of software development, the ability to accurately estimate project parameters and evaluate developer contributions is critical to a project’s success. Proper estimation helps set clear, achievable expectations for developers, which enhances their productivity and aligns their efforts with the project’s goals \cite{dmts1}. When developers see that their contributions are correctly recognized and rewarded, their motivation increases, leading to better work engagement. The relationship between work satisfaction and productivity is well-documented: when individuals feel valued for the job they perform, they are more inclined to improve and grow, fostering a positive cycle of motivation and productivity \cite{dmts1}.

The practice of estimating project timelines and budgets, as well as measuring developer productivity, has evolved significantly over time. Traditionally, project estimation involved basic metrics like the number of lines of code (LOC), budget allocation, and deadline setting \cite{dmts1}. While these methods provided a foundation, they often fell short of capturing the full complexity of modern software development environments. Similarly, developer contribution was historically measured by rudimentary metrics such as lines of code produced or the number of bugs fixed, failing to account for the qualitative aspects of a developer’s work, such as innovation, collaboration, or code quality \cite{dmts1}.

With the growing complexity of software projects, there has been a gradual shift toward more nuanced methods of collecting and analyzing productivity metrics. Agile methodologies have allowed organizations to directly link developer effort with the amount of tasks completed and the time spent on each. Techniques such as velocity tracking and continuous integration have introduced additional metrics for assessing both team and individual performance \cite{dmts1}. However, despite these advancements, many organizations still struggle to accurately predict project outcomes and fairly evaluate developer contributions \cite{dmts1}.

One of the major issues in project estimation is that it is often done incorrectly. Inexperienced or "immature" management teams tend to rely on outdated or incomplete data from previous projects. This approach fails to consider the dynamic nature of development teams and their history of productivity. For example, team cohesion, individual skill levels, and past project performance are often overlooked when estimating project complexity or setting deadlines \cite{dmts1}. As a result, projects are frequently over- or under-estimated, leading to missed deadlines, budget overruns, and a general decline in team morale.

Moreover, many project managers hold the mistaken belief that there is a set of universal metrics that can comprehensively assess all aspects of productivity and project complexity \cite{dmts1}. This reliance on oversimplified or misunderstood metrics contributes to the perpetuation of common myths in project management, which we will address in the next chapter. These misconceptions, coupled with incomplete data, result in suboptimal decision-making. Consequently, management often uses these flawed metrics to estimate future project parameters, compounding the problem \cite{dmts1}.

While estimating project outcomes and tracking developer productivity is no easy task, various methodologies have been developed to mitigate these challenges. Techniques like Earned Value Management (EVM), burn-down charts, and risk analysis aim to provide more accurate project forecasts \cite{dmts1}. However, even with these tools, predicting when a project will become unprofitable or how team dynamics will affect future outcomes remains a challenge for many organizations \cite{dmts1}.

That said, not all is bleak. There are mature teams and experienced managers who have mastered the use of tools and metrics to set realistic expectations for both themselves and their development teams. These teams leverage their understanding of metrics to maintain high productivity and consistently meet project deadlines and budget constraints \cite{dmts1}. However, as these teams grow in size, they encounter new challenges \cite{dmts1}. Scaling these processes effectively becomes more difficult, and the complexity of tracking productivity across larger teams can lead to diminishing returns \cite{dmts1}.

Despite the current state of project estimation and developer contribution analysis, there is substantial room for improvement. Our aim is not to critique the entire industry but to build on the foundation that already exists and push it forward. While there are teams that have mastered the art of project and productivity estimation, there is still a need for tools and frameworks that can help them maintain accuracy as they scale. Furthermore, many organizations are still in the process of mastering these techniques, and they too can benefit from a more structured approach to estimation.

This thesis aims to develop a tool that will assist teams and management in tracking productivity and accurately estimating future projects—whether that be setting deadlines, predicting budget overruns, or assessing team dynamics. To achieve this goal, we will address the following key questions:

- RQ 1: Which factors influence productivity?

  - RQ 1.1: Which factors influence productivity?
  - RQ 1.2: Which metrics are applied to measure those factors?
  - RQ 1.3: Which metrics among them are reliable?

- RQ 2: How productivity estimations relate to team ...?

  - RQ 2.1: What the productivity influencing factors can tell about a development team?
  - RQ 2.2: Which factors has more weight in the team description?
  - RQ 2.3: How to map metrics to team ...?

- RQ 3: How to estimate effort based on team data?
  - RQ 3.1: On what data is estimation based?
  - RQ 3.2: What factors influence effort estiamation?
  - RQ 3.3: What models are available and how to choose a model?
  - RQ 3.4: How to improve effort estimation?

By answering these questions, we hope to create a useful tool that will not only help mature teams continue to succeed as they scale but will also aid less experienced management teams in improving their estimation processes and decision-making. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a comprehensive framework that benefits all stakeholders in software development, from developers to project managers to upper management.

## Literature Review

The essence of estimating both productivity and project outcomes has long been understood—metrics and data are vital for all stakeholders, from developer leads to upper management and directors. However, despite the availability of metrics, many organizations do not succeed to estimate productivity and manage project planning. Our objective is to investigate why it is happening and propose a more effective approach to the use of metrics. We will explore which factors influence productivity as well as how they can be linked to project estimation in a meaningful way. By understanding the correct factors we will find related metrics to measure those factors. With these metrics we aim to define a clear framework for productivity and project estimation. This will also help us determine how to calculate project costs accurately. The following chapters will focus on the practical aspects of implementation and address the potential challenges in collecting and analyzing these metrics.

#### Problem with Metrics, Diverse Nature of Productivity

One of the most prevalent misconceptions in productivity estimation is the belief that a single metric can capture the entire picture. Many management teams and leads tend to rely on isolated metrics—whether it's the number of commits, lines of code, or hours worked—believing that these metrics alone provide a comprehensive view of developer productivity. However, all metrics have flaws, and when used in isolation, they can paint a misleading picture. Metrics are often subject to corruption, manipulation, or misinterpretation. For example, near project deadlines, developers may work longer hours, inflating activity metrics without necessarily reflecting real progress or quality.

Furthermore, different stakeholders require distinct sets of metrics. For example, management tends to focus on high-level metrics such as business outcomes and project timelines, while team leads might prioritize code quality and task completion. DevOps teams focus on operational efficiency, such as deployment frequency and uptime. These differing perspectives mean that no single metric can serve all needs, making it essential to gather a broad set of metrics from different dimensions.

The SPACE framework (Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Collaboration, and Efficiency) is a good example of how productivity should be viewed across multiple dimensions. Satisfaction, for example, is closely linked to productivity, as happier developers tend to produce higher-quality work and are less prone to burnout. Collaboration metrics reflect how well team members work together, while activity metrics track tangible outputs like commits and reviews. However, these activity metrics alone are insufficient without the context of performance and efficiency. A team that is performing well can often be many times more efficient than individual developers working in isolation, highlighting the importance of balancing team dynamics and individual contributions. Metrics should not just track outputs but also identify potential issues, such as burnout, dissatisfaction, and unrealistic expectations.

Research in software development increasingly acknowledges the impact of Developer Experience (DevX) on Developer Productivity (DevP). The study by Razzaq et al. (2024) provides a systematic review of the various DevX factors and the practices that enhance DevX, revealing their significant role in influencing DevP. The authors identified a range of DevX factors, such as work fragmentation, developer concentration, and availability of resources, as well as a suite of practices designed to improve these factors, thereby positively impacting productivity【26†source】.

According to the study, several essential practices have been identified as enhancing DevX in ways that positively affect productivity. These include minimizing interruptions, improving team collaboration, and ensuring a stable, supportive technical environment. For productivity evaluation, understanding the status of these DevX factors is crucial. Low indicators in DevX metrics may suggest the need to implement specific DevX practices, which can enhance team satisfaction, reduce inefficiencies, and ultimately boost overall productivity.

From Razzaq et al.'s work, we extracted and classified a list of measurable DevX metrics, organizing them by applicability and ease of collection. The table below presents these metrics and their categorization, providing a structured approach to incorporate DevX factors into our productivity measurement framework. In cases where specific DevX metrics fall below expectations, targeted DevX practices can be employed to address gaps, thereby aligning DevX with productivity goals in a data-driven way.

#### Issues in Project Estimation

Project estimation is another area where significant mistakes are commonly made. Many organizations rely on outdated or inaccurate data, often using tools like Gantt charts or relying on historical data that doesn't match the current project's context. This leads to faulty project estimations, especially when new projects differ substantially from past experiences. Project estimation models, such as the use of story points or task count statistics, attempt to predict project volume and complexity. While helpful to some extent, these methods are often flawed when the data they are based on is corrupted or misaligned with the project's unique requirements.

Another popular method, COCOMO 2, provides a more structured approach to project estimation but comes with its own set of limitations. Specifically, COCOMO 2 struggles with accurately reflecting team dynamics, work culture, and atmosphere. It also uses a broad set of parameters, some of which may be unclear or difficult to quantify. The rigid structure of models like COCOMO 2 can lead to inaccuracies, particularly in cases where human factors like satisfaction and team cohesion play significant roles in project outcomes.

#### A Correct Approach to Productivity and Project Estimation

To address these issues, productivity estimation should begin with accurate and comprehensive metric collection. Code-related metrics, such as churn rate, number of lines of code, and changes per commit, are essential, but they should be complemented by metrics related to story points, tasks completed, and time spent. These should be analyzed in relation to team satisfaction and cohesion, as both have a direct impact on long-term productivity.

When it comes to project estimation, a refined approach is necessary. We propose using an enhanced version of COCOMO 2 that incorporates better metrics and more reliable data derived from developer feedback and team estimation. For example, recent studies have demonstrated a correlation between developer satisfaction and project success. This suggests that satisfaction metrics can help predict the efficiency of the team and the likelihood of meeting project deadlines. By collecting and analyzing satisfaction data, we can better understand how a team’s organization affects its performance, and use this information to make more accurate project estimations.

#### Linking Productivity Metrics with Project Estimation

One of the key goals of this research is to establish a clear connection between productivity metrics and project estimation. Productivity metrics, such as task completion rates and code churn, have traditionally been treated separately from project estimation, but our research aims to show that these two areas are closely linked. A highly productive team is likely to meet deadlines more consistently and avoid cost overruns, while teams with low productivity may struggle to deliver on time. By using a combination of code metrics, satisfaction data, and team collaboration metrics, we can develop a more accurate model for predicting project success and estimating project costs.

#### Defining Useful Metrics for Productivity and Project Estimation

From our analysis, we have identified several key metrics that will be useful for our project estimation framework. These include traditional code metrics like lines of code and churn, as well as more nuanced metrics like team satisfaction, task complexity, and collaboration efficiency. By focusing on a multidimensional set of metrics, we can better understand the real productivity of developers and use this data to inform project estimations. This will allow us to answer our second research question: which metrics are the most useful for productivity and project estimation?

#### Using Statistics to Estimate Project Outcomes

Once we have collected the relevant metrics, the next step is to use statistical analysis to link this data to project outcomes. By examining patterns in productivity and satisfaction over time, we can develop models that predict the likelihood of project success, cost overruns, and missed deadlines. These models will take into account both the quantitative metrics (such as churn and task completion) and qualitative factors (such as developer satisfaction and team dynamics). By answering our third research question—how can statistics be used to estimate project outcomes?—we hope to provide a robust framework for improving project estimations.

In this chapter, we have explored the common myths and mistakes associated with productivity and project estimation, and proposed a more comprehensive approach to addressing these issues. By collecting the right metrics and using a multidimensional approach, we can better understand the productivity of development teams and make more accurate project estimations. In the next chapter, we will delve into the practical details of implementing this approach, including the challenges of collecting reliable metrics and using them effectively in project planning.
